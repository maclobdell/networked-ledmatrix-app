# LED matrix app for Hexiwear + Mbed Cloud

## Overview

This is based on a template application for Mbed Cloud (now called Pelion Device Management). It demonstrates how to create a simple Mbed Cloud Client application that can connect to Mbed Cloud, register resources and get ready to receive a firmware update.

It has been extended to add an LED matrix display.
